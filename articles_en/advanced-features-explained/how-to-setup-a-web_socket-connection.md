# How to setup a WebSocket connection?WebSockets establish a continuous connection between the client and server, enabling bi-directional communication.

Katalis.app utilizes this connection to provide real-time updates about platform events. To connect to the Katalis.app
WebSocket, simply provide a token and follow the setup instructions outlined in this guide.

Note: This feature is experimental, and the documentation may change with each release. Additionally, backward
compatibility cannot be guaranteed, so it is important to ensure you are using the latest version of the implementation.

Why should I use a WebSocket connection?

A WebSocket connection allows for real-time data updates, making it ideal for clients such as an Android or iOS client
SDK for Katalis.app. This helps update the dashboard without the need to reload the page. Hence, it can enhance the user
experience and improve an agent's productivity.

How to set up a WebSocket connection with Katalis.app?

To set up a WebSocket connection with Katalis.app, you need to initiate a connection with the authentication PubSub token
provided by Katalis.app. The URL for the connection is wss://<your-installation-url>/cable. If you are using Katalis.app
Cloud, you can use wss://app.katalis.app/cable as the URL.

A PubSub token is a token that is used to authenticate a client when connecting to a PubSub (publish-subscribe) service.
The client must present this token to the service in order to establish a connection and begin publishing or subscribing
to messages.

There are two types of PubSub tokens available in Katalis.app, as listed below.

1.  User PubSub Token: This token has the privileges of an agent/admin and would receive all of the events listed later
    on the page. You can get the PubSub token by calling the Profile API.

2.  Contact PubSub Token: Katalis.app generates a unique PubSub token for each session a contact has. This token can be
    used to connect to the WebSocket and receive real-time updates for the same session. When a contact is created
    through the public APIs, the pubsub_token is included in the response payload. This token only grants access to
    events related to the current session, such as conversation.created,
     conversation.status_changed, message.created, message.updated, conversation_typing_on, conversation_typing_off and presence.update.

Please refer Client APIs to build real time customer facing integrations using Katalis.app.

Note: This token may be rotated regularly based on your installation type. Please ensure that you are using the latest
token.

How to connect to Katalis.app WebSocket?

To connect to the Katalis.app WebSocket, use the command subscribe and include your pubSubToken, accountId, and userId (if
using a user token) in the connection request. Here is an example of how you can connect with Katalis.app.

// Add a helper method to convert JSON to a string
const stringify = (payload = {}) => JSON.stringify(payload);

const pubSubToken = "<contact/user-pub-sub-token>";
const accountId = "<your-account-id-in-integer>";
const userId = "<user-id-in-integer-if-using-user-token>";
const connection = new WebSocket(
  "wss://app.katalis.app/cable"
);

connection.send(
  stringify({
    command: "subscribe",
    identifier: stringify({
      channel: "RoomChannel",
      pubsub_token: pubSubToken,
      account_id: accountId,
      user_id: userId,
    }),
  })
);

// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"subscribe","identifier":"{\\"channel\\":\\"RoomChannel\\",\\"pubsub_token\\":\\"your-pubsub-token\\",\\"account_id\\": account_id_integer,\\"user_id\\":user_id_integer }"}

Publishing presence to the WebSocket server

To keep your users’ status online in Katalis.app, you can send a presence update event to Katalis.app every 30 seconds. This
action would keep the status of the agent/contact online.

How to update the presence of an agent/admin?

To update the presence of an agent or admin, send the following payload to the server:

const userPayload = stringify({
  command: "message",
  identifier: stringify({
    channel: "RoomChannel",
    pubsub_token: "<user-pubsub-token>",
    account_id: accountId,
    user_id: userId,
  }),
  data: stringify({ action: "update_presence" }),
});

connection.send(userPayload);
// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"message","identifier":"{\\"channel\\":\\"RoomChannel\\",\\"pubsub_token\\":\\"your-pubsub-token\\",\\"account_id\\": account_id_integer,\\"user_id\\":user_id_integer ","data":"{\\"action\\":\\"update_presence\\"}"}

How to update the presence of a contact?

To update the presence of a contact, send the following payload to the server:

const agentPayload = stringify({
  command: "message",
  identifier: stringify({
    channel: "RoomChannel",
    pubsub_token: "<user-pubsub-token>",
  }),
  data: stringify({ action: "update_presence" }),
});

connection.send(agentPayload);
// The expected string in connection.send is of the format:
// {"command":"message","identifier":"{\\"channel\\":\\"RoomChannel\\",\\"pubsub_token\\":\\"your-pubsub-token\\","data":"{\\"action\\":\\"update_presence\\"}"}
