# Setting up SAML AuthenticationThis is a guide on setting up SAML auth for your account, the guide assumes you have a work IdP in place.

Before you get started, there are some points to take note of

  - Once SAML is enabled, your users won't be able to access Katalis.app with their password. Disabling SAML will revert
    this behaviour.

  - If a user is part of multiple accounts, and any one account has SAML setup, they will have to login via SAML IdP
    only. It's best to restrict users to your domain alone.

Setting up SAML

You can find the SAML settings under Settings > Security. Here are the settings you need to be aware about.

  - SSO URL: The specific HTTPS address on the Identity Provider where a SAML login begins; your app redirects users
    here to authenticate. Think of it as the IdP’s “login endpoint” that accepts SAML AuthnRequests and starts the SSO
    flow.

  - Identity Provider Entity ID: A globally unique identifier (usually a URI-looking string) that names the Identity
    Provider in SAML metadata. Your Service Provider uses it to pick the right IdP config and to validate that inbound
    SAML messages really claim to be from that IdP.

  - Signing Certificate: The IdP’s X.509 public certificate used to sign SAML responses/assertions. Your Service
    Provider stores this cert and verifies signatures with it, ensuring the message wasn’t altered and truly came from
    the IdP.

Once setup, you will find the details required to register Katalis.app as a Service Provider (SP) on your SAML provider.
Here are the details you will get

  - ACS URL: The Assertion Consumer Service endpoint on the Service Provider that receives the SAML Response from the
    IdP. After the user authenticates, the IdP posts the signed assertion to this HTTPS URL, where your app validates it
    and creates a session.

  - SP Entity ID: The unique identifier (often a URI) for the Service Provider in SAML metadata. The IdP uses this value
    to ensure it’s issuing a response for the correct application and to select the right ACS URL and settings.

In case, you need this information before-hand, here's the format for it

  - ACS URL: <your-Katalis.app-installation>/omniauth/saml/callback?account_id=<your-account-id>

  - SP Entity ID: <your-Katalis.app-installation>/saml/sp/<your-account-id>

Mapping Data

The following attribute mappings must be configured in your identity provider

  - email

  - first_name

  - last_name

Once the user logs in for the first time, this information is used to create a user for them. It does not update the
information

Authenticating

You can navigate to this link https://app.katalis.app/app/login/sso to view the SAML login form. Just enter the email
address and the app will redirect you to the configured SAML provider.Last updated on Nov 04, 2025
