# Whatsapp templates

WhatsApp templates are pre-approved message formats that allow you to initiate conversations with your customers.

They're essential for sending promotional messages, order updates, and support notifications through WhatsApp Business
Platform.

Note: WhatsApp templates are currently supported only for WhatsApp Cloud inboxes.

## What are WhatsApp Templates?

WhatsApp templates are structured messages that must be approved by WhatsApp before you can send them to customers. They
help ensure compliance with WhatsApp's messaging policies while enabling you to send professional, consistent
communications.

Templates can include:

  - Text messages with personalized variables

  - Images, videos, or documents as headers

  - Action buttons for quick customer responses

  - Call-to-action buttons that link to websites or phone numbers

## Template Categories

WhatsApp organizes templates into different categories based on their purpose:

  - Utility - Transactional messages like order confirmations and receipts

  - Marketing - Promotional content and special offers

  - Shipping Update - Delivery and package status updates

  - Ticket Update - Support case notifications

  - Issue Resolution - Customer service follow-ups

## What is not supported

## Authentication templates

  - AUTHENTICATION templates with OTP codes and verification messages

  - Auto-population of button parameters with OTP values

  - OTP validation and expiry time handling

## Interactive components

  - LIST templates with selectable options

  - PRODUCT templates with catalog integration

  - CATALOG templates for product browsing

  - Multi-select components

## Call permission components

  - CALL_PERMISSION_REQUEST templates requiring WhatsApp calling API enabled

  - Call permission buttons and interactive call components

## Location components

  - LOCATION headers with map coordinates

  - Address parameters with latitude/longitude

  - Location-based templates

## Advanced features

  - Rich text formatting in template creation (preserved in sending)

  - Carousel templates with multiple cards

  - Form components for data collection

  - Payment integration templates

  - Flow templates with conditional logic

## Legacy vs Enhanced templates

Katalis.app supports two template formats to ensure compatibility with all your existing templates:

## Legacy templates

These are traditional templates that use simple text variables. They work with:

  - Basic text messages

  - Simple variable substitution (like inserting a customer name)

  - Straightforward button interactions

Legacy format example:

{
  "parameters": ["John Doe", "12345", "2025-01-15"]
}

⚠️ Important: Legacy template support will be discontinued in the v4.7. We recommend migrating to enhanced templates to
ensure continued functionality.

## Enhanced templates

The new enhanced format provides more sophisticated features:

  - Media support - Send images, videos, and documents

  - Advanced variables - More flexible text personalization

  - Interactive buttons - URL buttons with dynamic links, copy codes, and quick replies

  - Better validation - Real-time checking of your template parameters

Enhanced format example:

{
  "body": {
    "1": "John Doe",
    "2": "12345",
    "3": "2025-01-15"
  },
  "header": {
    "media_url": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "media_type": "image"
  },
  "buttons": [
    {
      "type": "url",
      "parameter": "track123"
    }
  ]
}

Note: All your existing legacy templates continue to work for now, but you should plan to transition to enhanced
templates. Enhanced features are automatically available when you use supported template types.

Please check this API to know about the request formats.

## How to create WhatsApp templates

Currently, WhatsApp templates must be created through WhatsApp Business Manager:

1.  Access WhatsApp business manager - Go to business.facebook.com

2.  Navigate to templates - Find the "Account tools" section and select "Message templates"

3.  Create new template - Click "Create template" and choose your template type

4.  Design your template - Add header, body, footer, and buttons as needed

5.  Submit for approval - WhatsApp will review your template (this can take up to 24 hours)

6.  Sync to Katalis.app - Once approved, templates will automatically appear or you can manually sync templates via inbox
    in Katalis.app

🚀 Coming Soon: We're planning to add template creation directly within the Katalis.app interface in a future release,
making it easier to design and manage your templates without leaving Katalis.app.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

## General Questions

## Why can't I see all my WhatsApp templates in Katalis.app?

Only templates that are approved by WhatsApp and supported by Katalis.app will appear. Unsupported template types (like
authentication templates with OTP codes) are automatically filtered out.

## How long does it take for new templates to appear in Katalis.app?

Templates typically sync automatically after some time and also you can update it manually from inbox settings.

## Can I edit templates directly in Katalis.app?

No, templates must be created and edited in WhatsApp Business Manager. Katalis.app is used only for sending approved
templates.

## Why do I need to provide URLs for images and videos?

WhatsApp requires media files to be hosted online and publicly accessible. You cannot upload files directly - you must
provide working URLs to your media content.

## Can I use the same template for different customers?

Yes! Templates are designed to be reused. Just fill in different customer information each time you send the template.

## Troubleshooting

## My template fails to send. What should I check?

Common issues include:

  - Missing variables - Ensure all required fields are filled

  - Broken media URLs - Verify your image/video/document links work

  - File size too large - Check that media files meet WhatsApp size limits

  - Template not approved - Confirm template status in WhatsApp Business Manager

## Why can't customers see my images/videos?

This usually means:

  - The URL is not publicly accessible

  - The file format is not supported

  - The file is too large

  - The hosting server is down or requires authentication

## My URL buttons don't work correctly. How do I fix this?

For templates with dynamic URL buttons, there are known issues with certain template configurations. Try using static
URLs instead of dynamic parameters for more reliable functionality.

## Can I send templates to customers who haven't messaged me first?

Yes, but only for certain template categories:

  - Utility templates can be sent anytime for transactional purposes

  - Marketing templates require customer opt-in and have specific sending windows

  - Always follow WhatsApp's compliance guidelines for your region

Media and Files

Compliance and limits

## How many templates can I send per day?

This depends on your WhatsApp Business account limits and message quotas. Contact WhatsApp support for specific limits
on your account.

## Are there restrictions on when I can send marketing templates?

Yes, marketing templates have specific sending windows and require customer opt-in. Check WhatsApp's current policies
for your region and business type.

## What happens if I send too many messages?

WhatsApp monitors message quality and delivery rates. Sending too many unsuccessful or unwanted messages can impact your
account's message limits and template approval rates.

## Need more help?

If you're experiencing issues not covered in this guide:

1.  Check template status in WhatsApp Business Manager

2.  Verify media URLs are working and publicly accessible

3.  Test with sample data before sending to customers

value to your customers with relevant, timely messages that respect their preferences.
