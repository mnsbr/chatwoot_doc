# How to use webhooks?Webhooks are HTTP callbacks that are set up for each account. These are triggered when actions such as creating a

message occur in Katalis.app. Multiple webhooks can be created for a single account.

How to add a webhook?

Step 1. Go to Settings → Integrations → Webhooks. Click on the "Configure" button.

Step 2. Click on the "Add new webhook" button. A modal will open up. Here, input the URL to which the POST request
should be sent. Next, you need to select the events you want to subscribe. This option would allow you to only listen to
the relevant events in Katalis.app.

Katalis.app will send a POST request with the following payload to the configured URLs for various updates in your account.

A sample webhook payload

{

  "event": "message_created", // The name of the event
  "id": "1", // Message ID
  "content": "Hi", // Content of the message
  "created_at": "2020-03-03 13:05:57 UTC", // Time at which the message was sent
  "message_type": "incoming", // This will have a type incoming, outgoing or template. The user from the widget sends incoming messages, and the agent sends outgoing messages to the user.

A sample webhook payload

{
  "event": "event_name"
  // Attributes related to the event
}

Webhook Events

Katalis.app supports the following webhook events. You can subscribe to them while configuring a webhook in the dashboard
or using the API.

conversation_created

This event will be triggered when a new conversation is created in the account. The payload for the event is as follows.

{
  "event": "conversation_created"
  // <...Conversation Attributes>
}

conversation_updated

This event will be triggered when there is a change in any of the attributes in the conversation.

{
  "event": "conversation_updated",
  "changed_attributes": [
    {
      "<attribute_name>": {
        "current_value": "",
        "previous_value": ""
      }
    }
  ]
  // <...Conversation Attributes>
}

conversation_status_changed

This event will be triggered when the status of the conversation is changed.

Note: If you are using agent bot APIs instead of webhooks, this event is not supported yet.

{
  "event": "conversation_status_changed"
  // <...Conversation Attributes>
}

message_created

This event will be triggered when a message is created in a conversation. The payload for the event is as follows.

{
  "event": "message_created"
  // <...Message Attributes>
}

message_updated

This event will be triggered when a message is updated in a conversation. The payload for the event is as follows.

{
  "event": "message_updated"
  // <...Message Attributes>
}

webwidget_triggered

This event will be triggered when the end user opens the live-chat widget.

{
  "event": "webwidget_triggered",
  "id": "",
  "contact": {
    // <...Contact Object>
  },
  "inbox": {
    // <...Inbox Object>
  },
  "account": {
    // <...Account Object>
  },
  "current_conversation": {
    // <...Conversation Object>
  },
  "source_id": "string",
  "event_info": {
    "initiated_at": {
      "timestamp": "date-string"
    },
    "referer": "string",
    "widget_language": "string",
    "browser_language": "string",
    "browser": {
      "browser_name": "string",
      "browser_version": "string",
      "device_name": "string",
      "platform_name": "string",
      "platform_version": "string"
    }
  }
}

conversation_typing_on

This event is triggered when an agent starts typing in a conversation. It could be either a private note or a message to
the customer. You can use the is_private flag to distinguish between the two.

{
  "event": "conversation_typing_on",
  "conversation": { ...<Conversation Object> },
  "user": { ... <User / AgentBot / Captain Object> },
  "is_private": true
}

conversation_typing_off

This event is triggered when an agent stops typing or when they leave the conversation window.

{
  "event": "conversation_typing_off",
  "conversation": { ...<Conversation Object> },
  "user": { ... <User / AgentBot / Captain Object> },
  "is_private": true
}

Verifying webhooks

Katalis.app signs every outgoing webhook request so your server can verify that the payload was sent by Katalis.app and has
not been tampered with. The secret is shown to you once the webhook is created, and you can view it again on the webhook
edit form.

Every webhook request sends the following headers, which can be used to compute the HMAC signature of the payload

  - X-Katalis.app-Signature: HMAC-SHA256 signature prefixed with sha256=

  - X-Katalis.app-Timestamp: Unix timestamp (seconds) when the request was signed

  - X-Katalis.app-Delivery: Unique delivery ID for the webhook event (when available)

The signature is computed as:

sha256=HMAC-SHA256(webhook_secret, "{timestamp}.{raw_body}")

Where:

  - webhook_secret is the secret associated with the webhook

  - timestamp is the value of the X-Katalis.app-Timestamp header

  - raw_body is the raw JSON request body (not parsed/re-serialized)

Verification Steps

1.  Extract X-Katalis.app-Signature and X-Katalis.app-Timestamp from the request headers

2.  Read the raw request body as bytes (do not parse and re-serialize)

3.  Compute the expected signature: sha256=HMAC-SHA256(secret, "{timestamp}.{raw_body}")

4.  Compare the computed signature with the received signature using a constant-time comparison

5.  Optionally, reject requests where the timestamp is too old to prevent replay attacks

Examples

Ruby

def verify_signature(raw_body, timestamp, received_signature, secret)
  expected = "sha256=#{OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest('SHA256', secret, "#{timestamp}.#{raw_body}")}"
  ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare(expected, received_signature)
end

Python

import hmac
import hashlib

def verify_signature(raw_body: bytes, timestamp: str, received_signature: str, secret: str) -> bool:
    message = f"{timestamp}.".encode() + raw_body
    expected = "sha256=" + hmac.new(secret.encode(), message, hashlib.sha256).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(expected, received_signature)

Node.js


const crypto = require("crypto");

function verifySignature(rawBody, timestamp, receivedSignature, secret) {
  const message = `${timestamp}.${rawBody}`;
  const expected =
    "sha256=" + crypto.createHmac("sha256", secret).update(message).digest("hex");
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(
    Buffer.from(expected),
    Buffer.from(receivedSignature)
  );
}

Go

import (
	"crypto/hmac"
	"crypto/sha256"
	"encoding/hex"
	"fmt"
)

func verifySignature(rawBody []byte, timestamp, receivedSignature, secret string) bool {
	mac := hmac.New(sha256.New, []byte(secret))
	mac.Write([]byte(fmt.Sprintf("%s.%s", timestamp, rawBody)))
	expected := "sha256=" + hex.EncodeToString(mac.Sum(nil))
	return hmac.Equal([]byte(expected), []byte(receivedSignature))
}

Important Notes

  - Always use the raw request body for verification. Parsing the JSON and re-serializing it may change key ordering,
    whitespace, or unicode escaping, which will produce a different signature.

  - Always use constant-time comparison (e.g., hmac.compare_digest, crypto.timingSafeEqual,
    ActiveSupport::SecurityUtils.secure_compare) to prevent timing attacks.

  - Consider rejecting requests with timestamps older than 5 minutes to mitigate replay attacks.Last updated on Feb 26, 2026
